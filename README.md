# Cross routines playground

Code to fiddle around with coroutines multi platform.

Demo of cross platform Kotlin coroutines with a Gradle multi project build.
For a talk on coroutines vs streams, futures, actors.

### Attribution
A lot of demo code is from https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines/ but extracted since that project is hard to compile locally. 
Since it currently doesn't work with IntelliJ 2019, requires a non free Oracle JVM for JavaFx and a local Android SDK.
